# Books---Take-Home-Assignment
Book Browser App ðŸ“š A native iOS app to browse and explore books using the dBooks API. Built with SwiftUI and Swift Concurrency, featuring search, filtering, sorting, and offline caching. Designed to showcase modern iOS development skills and an intuitive user experience. ðŸš€

## Requirements  

### Functional Requirements  
1. **Browse Books**: Users should be able to view a list of books retrieved from the API.  
2. **Book Details**: Users should be able to tap on a book to view its details, including title, author, description, and cover image.  
3. **Search**: Implement a feature that allows users to search for books by title or author.  
4. **Filtering, Sorting, and Categorizing**: Add functionality to filter and sort books (e.g., by subject, title, author, or other criteria).  
5. **Offline Mode**: Implement caching to display previously loaded books when the network is unavailable.  

### Technical Requirements  
1. **Native iOS**: Use the provided template app as a starting point and develop new features. Your project must be written in **Swift** and primarily use **SwiftUI** (bonus: integrate a small **UIKit** widget). Ensure compatibility with the latest version of Xcode.  
2. **Architecture**: Follow a modern architecture pattern such as **MVVM**.  
3. **Persistence**: Use Core Data, UserDefaults, or a persistence library to implement book caching.  
4. **Concurrency**: Use **Swift Concurrency** (async/await) for asynchronous operations.

### Bonus Requirements (Nice to Have):  
1. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests to validate your logic and ensure code reliability.  
2. **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Implement dependency injection or a service locator pattern to decouple your code.  
3. **UI/UX Enhancements**: Make the app visually appealing, add animations, and refine the user experience.
